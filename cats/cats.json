    "bow": "This cat is wearing a bow. It is orange and has a red bow - it probably didn't put it on. A human probably put the bow on but the cat doesn't seem to mind.",
    "crown": "This cat is wearing a crown. This is fitting, because cats are the kings of the universe. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a cat takeover one day... what a cat-astrophe! ha!",
    "curious": "This cat is sooo curious. Do you see how it is just looking around? it is probably trying to figure stuff out. It's so little and cute - marvel in it's cuteness.",
    "fluffy": "This cat is mega fluffy. It reminds me of a snowball. It's white, fluffy, and is being held by a human. I think this cat is very happy since it has a human to bond with.",
    "grumpy": "Now this is one grumpy cat. I don't think it's actually upset, it just looks that way to us. When cats get upset, they don't make the same facial expressions as humans.",
    "gus": "My girlfriend has a a bunch of cats and one of them is Gus. Gus is a gray cat - just like this one! they look very similar, but Gus is very old."
